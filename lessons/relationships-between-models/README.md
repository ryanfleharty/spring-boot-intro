# Establishing Relationships between Models

Create an app with two inter-related models. 

#### Learning Objectives

- Create a Spring Boot app with two models
- Establish a one to many relationship
- Return query results 

#### Prerequisites

- A basic spring boot application as as described in the [first](../starting-a-boot-project) [two](../data-backed-boot) lessons

First, let's handle the SQL side of this task. Since users can have many posts, and each post can have one user, this is a One to Many relationship. In that case, we add the Foreign Key to the post table, so add a column called `user_id` to your post table in MySql.

Then, add a private user field of type User to your Post model, which will represent the foreign key pointing to the post's creator. Be sure to add a getter and setter for the user field as well. Add the following annotations to that field:

```java
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name="user_id")
    private User user;
```

The @ManyToOne annotation says that this field of the post model will create a relationship with another table, where Post is the "many" side and the User is the "one" side (i.e. one user has many posts. Many posts can be joined to One user). @JoinColumn specifies which column in the SQL table holds the foreign key connecting the two.

This will also change the way we create a post, considering that the user's id won't be in the POST data sent in the request. We won't be implementing authentication quite yet, but we should set up our createPost function to allow for a user to be connected to each post. Use the UserRepository to query for a specific user (could be any existing user- we're just hardcoding the creator of each post for now) and attach them to each post you create.

Now when we query for a post, it will have the user attached. But what about the other way around? You might have guessed we can add a similar annotation to the User model, making sure to add getters and setters for this new field as well:

```java
    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, mappedBy="user")
    private Set<Post> posts;
```

Here, `mappedBy` is referring to what property of the Post model refers to the specific user.  Cascading is a database term meaning that the related model will be affected by changes to the current model, i.e. if a user is deleted, so are their posts. 

# Problem!

If you query it now, you will get a circular reference causing infinite recursion! When you grab a post, it will grab the user, which will try to grab the associated posts, which will grab the user, which will try to grab the associated posts...

There are several fixes to this issue, one of which is adding the following annotation to the Posts field in the User model:

```java
    @OneToMany(cascade= CascadeType.ALL, mappedBy = "user")
    @JsonIgnore
    private Set<Post> posts;
```

@JsonIgnore lets us ignore the list of posts when returning a user in JSON format. If we want to query for all the posts of a particular user, I would recommend creating a `users/{userId}/posts` route that returns all posts by the given user.

You can google around for various other solutions to the problem of infinite recursion when loading associations with Hibernate in Spring Boot projects.


### Try it out!

Use Postman to test full CRUDability of users and posts, making sure that when a user is deleted, so are their associated posts. Also, try adding another model that would establish one to many relationships, such as comments, and/or another model that would establish a many to many relationship, such as "liking" a post.
